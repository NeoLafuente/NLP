    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Dataset Description and Source\n",
    "\n",
    "### Origin and Creation Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this notebook originates from **EXIST 2025** (*sEXism Identification in Social neTworks*, fifth edition), a scientific shared task organized as a Lab within the **CLEF 2025 conference** (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum), held on September 9–12, 2025, at UNED, Madrid, Spain. EXIST is a recurring series of evaluation campaigns, active since 2021, dedicated to fostering automatic detection of sexism in social media — ranging from explicit misogyny to subtle, implicit sexist behaviours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this notebook corresponds specifically to **Task 1 (Sexism Detection in Tweets), Subtask 1.1 (Sexism Identification in Tweets)**, and consists of posts collected from **X/Twitter** in two languages: **English and Spanish**. The tweets were gathered using seed hashtags associated with potentially sexist content, and the collection strategy was designed to ensure broad topical and temporal coverage. The corpus contains **over 10,000 tweets** split into three official partitions:\n",

    "| Development | 1,038        |\n",
    "| Test        | 2,076        |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Annotation process.** Each tweet was independently labelled by **six human annotators** recruited and managed via Servipoli's annotation service at UPV (Universitat Politècnica de València). Annotators received task-specific training through multiple guided sessions before labelling began. Demographic metadata for annotators — including gender, age group, ethnicity, education level, and country of origin — is provided alongside the labels, enabling fairness-aware modelling and analysis of annotator subjectivity. Crucially, the dataset is released with **all individual annotations preserved** rather than a single adjudicated label, in keeping with the Learning with Disagreement (LeWiDi) paradigm adopted since EXIST 2023. This design choice reflects the organisers' position that inter-annotator disagreement on subjective tasks such as sexism identification is a meaningful signal, not noise to be discarded.\n",

    "### Shared Task Context\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field | Detail |\n",
    "|-------|--------|\n",
    "| **Task name** | EXIST 2025, Task 1 — Subtask 1.1: Sexism Identification in Tweets |\n",
    "| **Year** | 2025 |\n",
    "| **Organizing venue** | CLEF 2025 (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum), UNED, Madrid, Spain |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Classification Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtask 1.1 is a **binary text classification** task. Given a tweet written in English or Spanish, a system must determine whether the tweet contains sexist content — understood in a broad sense as any expression, attitude, or behaviour that discriminates against, demeans, or subordinates individuals on the basis of gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "The breadth of this definition is intentional: a tweet qualifies as sexist not only when it actively promotes sexist views, but also when it describes or reports a sexist situation experienced by the author, or when it critically comments on sexist behaviour, provided the content itself involves or depicts sexist discourse. This inclusivity makes the class boundary non-trivial and inherently subjective, motivating the multi-annotator design described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label Meanings\n",
    "\n",
    "| Label | Real-World Meaning |\n",
    "|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **YES** *(sexist)* | The tweet *contains* sexist expressions, attitudes, or behaviours directed at individuals on the basis of gender. This encompasses content that is overtly misogynistic or harassing; content that reinforces gender-based stereotypes or power imbalances; content that recounts a sexist experience, even when doing so critically; and content that deploys irony or humour to convey sexist ideas. The label captures sexism in its broadest social sense — from blatant verbal aggression to the subtle normalisation of gender inequality. |\n",
    "| **NO** *(not sexist)* | The tweet does not contain sexist expressions or behaviours. Its content is neutral with respect to gender-based discrimination, or, if it touches on gender topics, it does so without reproducing or endorsing sexist attitudes. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Dataset Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset presents several interlocking difficulties that make it substantially harder than standard binary text classification benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subjectivity and Legitimate Annotator Disagreement\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental challenge is that sexism detection is **inherently subjective**. The same tweet can be read as sexist or ironic, as a joke or as normalisation of gender inequality, depending on the cultural background, personal experience, and social sensitivity of the reader. This is not annotation noise — it is a genuine property of the phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Borderline Class: \"Judgemental\" Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly difficult subcategory involves tweets that **condemn** sexist behaviour. Under the task definition these are labelled YES (sexist) because they depict sexist situations — but their surface form is often indistinguishable from clearly NOT SEXIST content. A tweet reading *\"disgusting that my colleague was passed over for promotion because she's a woman\"* is anti-sexist in intent, yet is labelled SEXIST because it describes gender discrimination. This label assignment, while principled, is counter-intuitive and a systematic source of model errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seed-Induced Topical Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus was constructed using hashtag seeds, which means tweets are topically skewed toward discussions *about* gender and sexism. NOT SEXIST tweets in this dataset are not generic neutral content — they are non-sexist tweets harvested from the same gender-adjacent hashtag space. This makes the negative class more challenging than it appears: a model cannot simply learn to associate gender-related vocabulary with the SEXIST label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code-Switching, Irony, and Platform-Specific Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweets are characterised by:\n",
    "- **Extreme brevity** (280 characters maximum), which limits contextual information. Meaning often depends on pragmatic implication, hashtag context, or tone that is absent in text form.\n",
    "- **Irony and sarcasm**, which systematically mislead literal classifiers. A tweet such as *\"Haha what would women do without men to open jars for them\"* carries its sexism through ironic framing rather than literal proposition.\n",
    "- **Non-standard language**: creative spelling, emoji, hashtag concatenation (e.g., `#adaywithoutwomen`), abbreviations, and code-switching between English and informal slang are all frequent and may not be well-handled by standard tokenization.\n",
    "- **Multilingual content**: the bilingual (English/Spanish) design means any single-language model will fail on the complementary language, and cross-lingual generalisation is non-trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Sample Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples are taken directly from the official task description (Plaza et al., 2025) and illustrate representative cases from each class. They are chosen to convey the range of difficulty in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label: YES (Sexist)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example S-1** — *Direct sexism through anti-feminist framing (ironic/ideological):*\n",
    "> *\"It's less of #adaywithoutwomen and more of a day without feminists, which, to be quite honest, sounds lovely.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "The sexism here is not expressed through slurs but through the dismissal of women's collective action as something undesirable. The use of a real social movement hashtag contextualises the tweet as a response to feminist activism. The ironic register makes it harder to detect automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example S-2** — *Direct sexism through gender-role prescription:*\n",
    "> *\"A woman needs love, to fill the fridge, if a man can give this to her in return for her services, I don't see what else she needs.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This tweet encodes a transactional view of gender relations and reduces women's needs to domestic and emotional dependencies. Sexism is explicit here, but still expressed through implication rather than slurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example S-3** — *Reported/judgemental sexism — author is a victim recounting harassment:*\n",
    "> *\"I doze in the subway, I open my eyes feeling something weird: the hand of the man sat next to me on my leg #SquealOnYourPig.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This tweet is labelled SEXIST because it describes a sexist assault — not because the author holds sexist views. It is the most counter-intuitive class for models: surface-level, it resembles a first-person narrative by a victim; semantically, it depicts gendered violence. The hashtag `#SquealOnYourPig` signals a protest context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label: NO (Not Sexist)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example N-1** — *Neutral observation involving a woman, no gendered framing:*\n",
    "> *\"Just saw a woman wearing a mask outside spank her very tightly leashed dog and I gotta say I love learning absolutely everything about a stranger in a single instant.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "The tweet mentions a woman but treats her as an individual acting in a particular way — there is no generalisation, subordination, or gender-based framing. The classifier must learn not to fire on mentions of women per se.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example N-2** — *Judgemental anti-sexism tweet condemning gender inequality:*\n",
    "> *\"As usual, the woman was the one quitting her job for the family's welfare...\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates a key decision boundary challenge. The ellipsis conveys implicit criticism of a sexist social norm, but does not endorse it. Under the EXIST annotation guidelines this tweet is **NOT SEXIST** because the author's intention is condemnation — in contrast to Example S-3, where the depiction of a sexist act tips the label toward SEXIST. The difference is subtle and annotators reliably disagree on such cases."

    "\n",
    "### Official Evaluation Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The EXIST 2025 shared task follows a standard blind evaluation protocol: the **test split labels are withheld** and participants must submit predictions to the organizers' evaluation platform (**EvALL**, hosted at https://evall.uned.es/) to receive scores. This design prevents overfitting to the test distribution and ensures fair comparison across teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for Baseline Development\n",
    "\n",
    "While the blind evaluation paradigm is appropriate for competitive shared tasks, it presents challenges for **exploratory research and qualitative error analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No local test evaluation:** We cannot compute performance metrics on the official test split without submitting to EvALL, which limits iteration speed during model development.\n",
    "- **No error inspection:** Without access to test labels, we cannot conduct failure analysis, inspect misclassified examples, or diagnose model weaknesses — all essential for scientific understanding beyond pure performance optimization.\n",
    "- **No soft-label evaluation:** The EvALL platform supports both hard and soft evaluation (see §1.2), but local experimentation requires ground-truth soft labels, which are unavailable for the test split in our development environment.\n",

    "- **Stopword removal** (`no_stopwords`) performs nearly as well as lowercase (F1: 0.6496), but risks removing negations (\"not\", \"no\") and other function words critical for sentiment/stance detection in short texts.\n",
    "- **Stemming** and **lemmatization** reduce vocabulary further but at a cost: they conflate words with different connotations (e.g., \"abuse\" vs. \"abusive\") and introduce errors on social media text with non-standard spelling.\n",

    "- The small performance difference between lowercase (0.6506) and more aggressive strategies (stemmed: 0.6493, no_stopwords: 0.6496) does not justify the added computational cost or risk of semantic loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Robustness to Twitter-specific noise**\n",
    "- Twitter users employ inconsistent capitalization for emphasis (e.g., \"MEN ARE TRASH\" vs. \"men are trash\"). Lowercasing treats these as equivalent, which is appropriate for sexism detection where surface form variation does not change meaning.\n",

    "1. **Logistic Regression slightly outperforms SVM by ~0.12 F1 points.** The difference is marginal, suggesting both linear classifiers perform comparably on this dataset. The probabilistic nature of LR may provide a slight edge in calibration for the noisy, bilingual tweet data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`class_weight=None` preferred for both models.** Despite the slight class imbalance (51% sexist / 49% not sexist in training), balanced weighting did not improve performance. This is consistent with the near-balanced class distribution, where reweighting introduces unnecessary noise rather than addressing a meaningful imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Both models prefer standard TF-IDF (`binary=False`).** Frequency-based features outperform binary term presence for both classifiers, indicating that term frequency carries useful discriminative signal for this task. The key difference is that LR benefits from **sublinear TF scaling** (`log(1+tf)`) to dampen high-frequency terms, while SVM performs slightly better with raw frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maximum vocabulary size (`max_features=40 000`) works best**, confirming that removing features through aggressive vocabulary pruning discards useful discriminative tokens. Both models also prefer `min_df=1`, retaining even rare terms. With unigrams only, 40 000 features effectively covers the full vocabulary without introducing excessive noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Regularization strength:** LR favors moderate regularization (`C=1`), while SVM prefers stronger regularization (`C=0.1`). This indicates that SVM is more prone to overfitting on this high-dimensional TF-IDF feature space and benefits from tighter constraints on the decision boundary.\n",

    "For the dense representation approach, we trained **FastText word embeddings from scratch** on the task corpus and used a **MeanEmbeddingVectorizer** to convert each tweet into a fixed-length vector by averaging all word embeddings. The hyperparameter search was conducted using **5-fold stratified cross-validation**, exploring:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Hyperparameter | Values Tested |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| `vect__vector_size` | 100, 300 |\n",
    "| `vect__window` | 3, 5 |\n",
    "| `clf__C` | 0.1, 1, 10 |\n",
    "| `clf__class_weight` | None, balanced |\n",

    "\n",
    "| Model | Best F1-Macro (CV) | Embedding Settings | Classifier Settings |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Logistic Regression** | **0.5080** | vector_size=300, window=5 | C=0.1, class_weight=None |\n",
    "| **SVM (LinearSVC)** | **0.5404** | vector_size=100, window=3 | C=10, class_weight=None |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dense models significantly underperform sparse models** (best dense F1 = 0.5404 vs. best sparse F1 = 0.6536, a gap of ~11.3 F1 points). This is a substantial and consistent difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why dense representations struggle on this task:**\n",
    "   - **Information loss from averaging:** Mean-pooling word embeddings into a single vector destroys word-order, negation, and sarcasm cues that are critical for sexism detection.\n",
    "   - **Small corpus for embedding training:** FastText was trained from scratch on only ~6 920 tweets, which is insufficient to learn high-quality distributional semantics. Pre-trained embeddings (e.g., Twitter-specific GloVe or multilingual models) would likely perform better.\n",
    "   - **Embedding dimensionality trade-off:** LR performed better with higher dimensionality (300) while SVM preferred lower dimensionality (100), suggesting that the interaction between embedding size and classifier type is non-trivial on a small corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`class_weight=None` preferred in dense models**, consistent with the sparse models. The near-balanced class distribution means that reweighting does not provide benefits in either representation paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SVM outperforms LR in the dense setting** (opposite of sparse), likely because SVM's max-margin approach handles the lower-quality, more overlapping feature space of mean embeddings better. SVM also prefers weaker regularization (`C=10`), allowing the model to fit more aggressively to the noisy dense features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision:** The sparse approach (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) is decisively superior. We will use the **best sparse model** as our primary submission model, but will also generate dense model predictions (using the best dense SVM) for comparison.\n"

    "## 6.2.2 Error Analysis\n",
    "**False Positives (126): NOT SEXIST → predicted SEXIST**\n",
    "The model over-predicts sexism due to three patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trigger keywords used in neutral contexts. Words like mgtow, patriarchy, and #notallmen frequently co-occur with sexist tweets in training data, so the model treats them as strong SEXIST signals. However, many FP tweets mention these terms innocuously — e.g., a tweet about a deodorant brand that looked like \"patriarchy\", or someone simply replying to a user named @bruno_mgtow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Abuse\" vocabulary in non-gendered contexts. Words like abusar, privilegios, and violencia trigger the SEXIST prediction, but in the FP examples they refer to political abuse (\"abusar del pueblo\") or alcohol (\"probar y abusar\"), not gender-based situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Discussing gender ≠ being sexist. Tweets about \"gender violence prevention programs\" or \"overpopulation\" touch on gender-related topics but carry no sexist attitude. The model confuses topic (gender) with stance (sexist).\n",
    "\n",
    "**False Negatives (134): SEXIST → predicted NOT SEXIST**\n",
    "The model fails to detect sexism when it is expressed subtly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Denouncing sexism still counts as SEXIST. Tweets like \"the gaming community is a den of misogynists\" or \"I suffer the aftermath of so much abuse\" criticize sexism, but under the EXIST annotation guidelines, depicting a sexist situation = SEXIST label. The model picks up on the anti-sexist tone and predicts NOT SEXIST.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Irony and sarcasm. The model cannot detect irony. \"body positivity mis pelotas :)\" mocks body positivity, but the individual words do not look sexist. Similarly, \"micromachismo reminds me of South Park\" — the sexism lies in the dismissive tone, not in the words themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do these errors occur?\n",
    "Both error types trace back to the same root cause: TF-IDF + a linear model only sees which words are present, not how they are used. It cannot distinguish whether patriarchy is mentioned as a joke or seriously, it cannot detect sarcasm or irony, and it cannot separate talking about sexism from being sexist. These are inherent limitations of the bag-of-words approach, confirming the value of this baseline as a reference point for contextual models (e.g., BERT, XLM-R) that can capture these subtleties.\n",

    "# 7. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presented a complete pipeline for **sexism identification in tweets** (EXIST 2025, Task 1, Subtask 1.1), a **binary text classification** task evaluated using **F1-Macro** on a bilingual (English/Spanish) dataset of ~10 000 tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Preprocessing matters — but less is more\n",
    "Among six preprocessing strategies tested (raw, lowercase, no punctuation, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization), simple **lowercasing** achieved the best F1-score (0.6506) while maintaining computational efficiency. More aggressive preprocessing (stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal) degraded performance by discarding discriminative information present in Twitter-specific text patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unigrams outperform higher-order n-grams\n",
    "Despite intuition that multi-word phrases should help capture sexist expressions, **unigrams alone** consistently outperformed bigram and trigram configurations. This is attributable to the **feature space explosion** (37k → 325k tokens) coupled with insufficient training data (~6 900 samples), causing severe overfitting with higher-order n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Sparse representations decisively outperform dense embeddings\n",
    "- **Best sparse model** (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression): **F1-Macro = 0.6536**\n",
    "- **Best dense model** (FastText + LinearSVC): **F1-Macro = 0.5404**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ~11.3 F1-point gap demonstrates that for small, domain-specific datasets, well-tuned TF-IDF features capture more task-relevant information than from-scratch word embeddings. The mean-pooling strategy used for dense representations further degrades performance by destroying word-order and negation information critical for detecting subtle sexism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Class balancing is not beneficial for this near-balanced dataset\n",
    "Both the best sparse and dense classifiers achieved their best performance with `class_weight=None`. Given the near-equal class distribution in the training set (51.3% sexist / 48.7% not sexist), explicit class reweighting introduces unnecessary perturbation rather than correcting a meaningful imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. TF-IDF configuration is as important as classifier choice\n",
    "Key TF-IDF parameters — such as `binary`, `sublinear_tf`, `min_df`, and `max_features` — had substantial impact on performance. Retaining the full vocabulary (`max_features=40 000`, `min_df=1`) was important, confirming that even rare terms carry discriminative signal. The best sparse model used standard frequency-based TF-IDF with sublinear scaling (`binary=False`, `sublinear_tf=True`), indicating that dampened term frequencies provide the best feature representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Qualitative error analysis reveals fundamental BoW limitations\n",
    "Evaluation on the held-out set yielded a **25.0% error rate** (260 misclassifications out of 1 038 samples), split into **134 false negatives** and **126 false positives**. False negatives predominantly involve tweets reporting or condemning sexism — content that is labelled SEXIST under the task guidelines but lacks overtly sexist vocabulary. False positives are driven by the model's reliance on gender-related keywords (`#MeToo`, `patriarchy`, `abuse`), regardless of contextual intent. These patterns highlight the inherent limitation of bag-of-words approaches in capturing pragmatic meaning, irony, and speaker intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-trained embeddings:** Using large pre-trained models (e.g., multilingual BERT, Twitter-specific embeddings) would likely bridge the gap between sparse and dense approaches.\n",
    "2. **Contextual models:** Transformer-based architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-R) could capture pragmatic meaning and sarcasm that BoW models miss.\n",
    "3. **Advanced preprocessing:** Tweet-specific tokenizers (e.g., TweetTokenizer from NLTK) and emoji/hashtag-aware preprocessing could improve feature quality.\n",
    "4. **Ensemble methods:** Combining sparse and dense model predictions could potentially outperform either approach alone.\n",
    "5. **Data augmentation:** Given the limited dataset size, techniques like back-translation or synonym replacement could help reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "The best-performing model (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF with optimized hyperparameters) was used to generate predictions on the test set, saved as `sparse_preds.json` for submission.\n"
