        "\n",
        "Tokenization is the fundamental preprocessing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where raw text is decomposed into meaningful linguistic units called **tokens**. These tokens serve as the primary input to virtually all downstream NLP models, from traditional statistical models to modern deep learning architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "The importance of tokenization cannot be overstated: the choice of tokenization strategy directly impacts model performance, computational efficiency, vocabulary size, and the model's ability to generalize to unseen language phenomena.\n",

        "### 2.1 Information-Theoretic Perspective\n",
        "\n",
        "From an information theory standpoint, tokenization seeks to find an optimal balance between compression and representational capacity. Consider the entropy of a vocabulary:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Entropy of vocabulary V:**\n",
        "$$H(V) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{|V|} p(v_i) \\log_2 p(v_i)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $p(v_i)$ is the probability of token $v_i$ in the corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to minimize vocabulary entropy while maintaining linguistic information. Subword tokenization achieves this through recursive partitioning of high-frequency character sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Vocabulary Construction Algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2.2.1 Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)\n",
        "\n",
        "BPE iteratively merges the most frequent adjacent byte or character pairs:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Algorithm:**\n",
        "```\n",
        "Initialize: vocabulary = all characters in corpus\n",
        "While vocabulary_size < target_size:\n",
        "    1. Count all adjacent pair frequencies\n",
        "    2. Merge most frequent pair\n",
        "    3. Add new token to vocabulary\n",
        "    4. Update corpus with merged pair\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Complexity:** O(n·k) where n is corpus size and k is iterations\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2.2.2 WordPiece Tokenization\n",
        "\n",
        "WordPiece, used in BERT, extends BPE by using likelihood scores instead of raw frequency:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Merge criterion:**\n",
        "$$score(A, B) = \\frac{freq(AB)}{freq(A) \\times freq(B)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This likelihood-based approach prefers meaningful combinations over frequent but semantically unrelated pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2.2.3 SentencePiece\n",
        "\n",
        "SentencePiece treats tokenization as a sequence modeling problem and builds vocabulary directly from raw bytes without language-specific preprocessing:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key properties:**\n",
        "- Handles any language uniformly (language-agnostic)\n",
        "- Preserves information about whitespace (uses special token ▁)\n",
        "- Supports both BPE and Unigram variants\n",
        "- No preprocessing required (no dependency on language-specific text normalization)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.3 Formal Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "A tokenizer $\\mathcal{T}$ is a function:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\mathcal{T}: \\Sigma^* \\rightarrow V^*$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- $\\Sigma^*$ is the space of all possible text sequences\n",
        "- $V^*$ is the space of all possible token sequences\n",
        "- $|V| \\ll |\\Sigma|$ (vocabulary is much smaller than character alphabet)\n",
        "\n",
        "The tokenizer must satisfy:\n",
        "1. **Surjectivity on training data**: Every token in $V$ appears at least once\n",
        "2. **Invertibility (approximate)**: Text can be reconstructed with minimal loss\n",
        "3. **Consistency**: Same input always produces same tokenization\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.4 Linguistic Properties of Tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "Tokens should ideally exhibit these properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Morphological coherence**: Related word forms share token prefixes\n",
        "   - Example: \"running\", \"runner\", \"runs\" → [\"run\", \"+ing\"], [\"run\", \"+er\"], [\"run\", \"+s\"]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Semantic preservation**: Tokens combine to preserve meaning\n",
        "   - Example: \"unhappy\" → [\"un\", \"happy\"] (negation + base)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Frequency robustness**: Token frequency distribution follows Zipfian law\n",
        "   - P(token_rank) ∝ rank^(-α), typically α ≈ 1-1.5\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2.5 Morphological Normalization: Stems vs. Lemmas\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of tokenization, simply splitting text is often insufficient to capture the semantic core of a word. To reduce vocabulary size and group related concepts, we often rely on **Stemming** and **Lemmatization**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.5.1 Definitions\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Stem (Stemming)\n",
        "- **Definition:** A crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words to reduce them to a base form. It does not require a dictionary and typically uses rule-based algorithms (e.g., Porter Stemmer).\n",

        "\n",
        "The relationship depends on the generation of tokenizer:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Classical Tokenizers (Word-level)\n",
        "- Often relied heavily on **stemming** as a pre-processing step to reduce vocabulary size.\n",
        "- **Example:**  \n",
        "  If you tokenized *\"run\"*, *\"running\"*, and *\"runs\"* as separate words, your vocabulary grows quickly.  \n",
        "  Stemming reduced them all to *\"run\"* before training.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Linguistic Tokenizers (spaCy)\n",
        "- These prioritize **lemmatization**.\n",
        "- As seen in spaCy code (`token.lemma_`), they aim to provide the most linguistically accurate representation of the text for tasks like information extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Modern Subword Tokenizers (BPE / WordPiece)\n",
        "- These models generally do **not** perform explicit stemming or lemmatization.\n",
        "- Instead, they rely on **segmentation** to achieve a similar effect implicitly.\n",
        "- **Example:**  \n",
        "  BPE might tokenize *\"looking\"* into `[\"look\", \"ing\"]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The token *\"look\"* effectively acts as the lemma/stem.\n",
        "  - The token *\"ing\"* captures the morphological information.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows the model to understand that *\"looking\"* and *\"looked\"* share the same root (*look*) without requiring a separate lemmatization step.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2.5 Text Representation: The Unicode Standard\n",
        "\n",
        "Before text can be tokenized, it must be represented as bytes. In modern NLP, **Unicode** is the universal standard.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.5.1 What is Unicode?\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike ASCII (which only supports English characters), Unicode maps virtually every character in every human language (plus emojis and symbols) to a unique number called a **code point**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Code Point:** The unique ID for a character, usually written as `U+XXXX`.\n",

        "  UTF-8 is the dominant encoding because it is **variable-length**:\n",
        "  - 1 byte for English characters\n",
        "  - Up to 4 bytes for emojis and rare symbols\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2.5.2 The Normalization Trap\n",
